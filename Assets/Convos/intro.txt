You: Man, life sucks.
You: My favorite arcade game broke, now I have no way to get the tickets I need for that life-sized shark plushie. With the arcade shutting down next week, too, I'll never be able to!
You: I mean, I guess I could play Skee-Ball instead, but it doesn't even have flippers so what's the point?

Satan: Hey, you there, gullible-looking child!
{
You: Me?
}
Satan: Yeah you, you seem pretty easy to coerce.
{
You: That's true, I'd do just about anything for some tickets right now.
}
Satan: I happen to have some to spare, but I can't just give them to you.
Satan: I propose that we strike a little deal. We'll play a game. If you win, I will give you as many tickets as your heart desires. I'll even let you choose the game.
{
You: And what if I lose?
}
Satan: I get your soul.
{
You: Oh okay.
}
Satan: So... whaddaya say?
{
You: Deal.
}
Satan: Wonderful. What'll it be? Some game of skill? Poker? Chess? Blackjack?
{
You: Pinball.
}
Satan: Then it is- wait, pinball? That's not even a multiplayer game, dude.
{
You: Sucks to suck I guess.
}
Satan: Whatever.
Satan: Go ahead, try to beat my high score. I think you'll find the machine is a bit different than what you're used to.
